# Today
> A small, git-based task tracking tool.

Run `./today` to get the list of pendings from yesterday, and add new things to do.

Run `./done <n>` to get the list of done things in the past `n` days. `0` for done today.

Inside `today` you have a few shortcuts for handling todos:

* `<leader>o` to add a new todo
* `<leader>x` to mark a todo as done
* `<leader>z` to mark a todo as undone
* `<leader>-` to mark a todo as skipped
